These generators are being used as a temporary hack/solution to add Bun support to the output of the Prisma NestJS/GraphQL generator.

In short, adding '& {}' to certain types forces TypeScript to treat them as object types, which helps resolve some type compatibility issues when using Prisma-generated code with Bun.

I just note this as the code in this folder was quickly thrown together in the hopes that it we will be able to remove it in the near future.
