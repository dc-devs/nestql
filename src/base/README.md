# Base

This folder holds the application "base" or core code. The idea here is I could copy/paste this folder into a new NestJS project and take advantage of all the initial work needed to get a basic CRUD app up and running.

It sets up GraphQl support and conains items like a resuable CRUD Resolver/Service using the Repository pattern that can be shared between all models in this application.
